            Oops! It looks like the page youâ€™re trying to access doesnâ€™t exist.
            Maybe it went on vacation, decided to explore the universe, or got
            lost somewhere between two black holes. ðŸŒŒ
          </p>
          <p>
            But donâ€™t worry, youâ€™re not lost in space (yet). You can safely
            return to the <a href='/'>home page</a> or go to your{' '}
            <a href='/history'>history</a> â€” or just stay here and pretend you
            found a secret page that only the coolest explorers can access. ðŸ§­âœ¨
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think this page should exist (or if you want to chat about
            time travel and wormholes), just get in touch. Otherwise, use the
            menu to head back to the real world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, hereâ€™s a thought: "If a page doesnâ€™t exist on the
            internet, did it ever really exist?" ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
